# Building-extraction-with-U-Net-in-High-Resolution-RGB-Images
This repository showcases an efficient implementation of the U-Net architecture for building segmentation in high-resolution RGB images. It effectively addresses challenges such as shadows, occluded areas, vegetation, complex roofs, and dense urban areas. The U-Net architecture used in this project is based on the research paper "Multiscale building segmentation based on deep learning
for remote sensing RGB images from different sensors", and for access to the dataset used, please contact the original paper's author via email.
